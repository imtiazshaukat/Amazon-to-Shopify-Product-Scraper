Amazon to Shopify Product Scraper
This project is a simple JavaScript snippet that scrapes product data from an Amazon product page and formats it for Shopify-compatible CSV import. It extracts product details like title, price, description, and images — then generates structured JSON entries that can be used to populate a Shopify store.

🚀 Features
Extracts:

1. Product title

2. Product description

3. Price

4. "About this item" bullet points

5. Key product details (like material, care instructions, etc.)

6. Product images


🧠 Use Case
This is especially useful when you're:

1. Dropshipping from Amazon

2. Importing data for product research

3. Bulk uploading products into Shopify with media assets

4. Automating store data entry
   
🛠 How to Use
1. Go to any Amazon product page (e.g., jeans, gadgets, kitchenware, etc.).

2. Open Developer Tools (Right click → Inspect → Console tab).

3. Paste the script from scraper.js into the console and hit Enter.

4. Copy the generated JSON output.

5. Convert it to CSV using any online tool or script.
